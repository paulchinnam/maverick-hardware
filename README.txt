This repo contains scripts for my Nvidia Jetson Orin Nano Mini-based project: 'Maverick.ai'

Maverick is the name of my customized Jetson-based system (see full project blog (yet to be posted))

lcd_controller.py collects and displays hardware metrics from the board using the Jetson-Stats and CharLCD libraries respectively.

## Resources
1. Jetson-Stats Documentation: https://rnext.it/jetson_stats/index.html
2. RPLCD Documentation: https://rplcd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/usage.html

## TODO
1. Run lcd_controller.py on system startup
2. Write script to control on and reset buttons
3. Run button script on system startup
